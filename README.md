This is how the data looks like and the users are able to apply for the jobs in the app itself but it redirect to the original website.



### Conclusion
- This application makes the job search easier.
- The problem is that this application is not dynamic for updating the new data which we can improve in the future.
- The users can also do analysis with the data according to their skills.
